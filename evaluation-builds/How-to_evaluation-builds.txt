Beta releases (evaluation-builds)
It's always a good practice to back up your files, before the installation of a beta release. 

1. Windows environment :
If Webgraplus has been installed thru the installer, files are located in C:\Program Files (x86)\WebGrab+Plus\bin, backup the folder bin or all the files contained.
Then just overwrite all the files .exe .dll etc. etc with the one contained in the zip file downloaded from github https://github.com/SilentButeo2/webgrabplus-siteinipack/tree/master/evaluation-builds.
First run you will be asked to authorize the new app to run, click on more info and then run anyway.

2. Linux
Is pretty much the same procedure of windows, files are usually located in /home/username/Desktop/.wg++/bin unless you have changed location.
Backup the contenent of .wg++/bin folder. 
Then just overwrite all the files .exe .dll etc. etc with the one contained in the zip file downloaded from github https://github.com/SilentButeo2/webgrabplus-siteinipack/tree/master/evaluation-builds.
Make sure the .exe file have permission 755
